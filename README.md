# Number Analyzer - Java

This is a beginner-level Number Analyzer program written in Java. It uses the `Scanner` class for user input and analyzes an integer based on several conditions.

## How to Use

- Run the program.
- Enter an integer when prompted.
- The program will determine:
  - If the number is positive, negative, or zero.
  - If the number is even or odd.
  - If the number is greater than or less than (or equal to) 100.

## Features

- Number classification (positive, negative, or zero).
- Parity check (even or odd).
- Comparison check (greater than or less than/equal to 100).
- Clear and simple console output.

## Concepts Used

- `Scanner` for user input
- `if-else` conditionals
- Ternary operator (`? :`) for simple condition
- String concatenation
- Basic input validation (closing the scanner)
